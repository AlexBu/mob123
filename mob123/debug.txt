iphone progress:
ps -ax //get pid and process path
otool -l <app> | grep crypt //get crypt offset, crypt size
gdb -e ./<app> // load app
(gdb) set sharedlibrary load-rules ".*" ".*" none	// don't know why set these args
(gdb) set inferior-auto-start-dyld off
(gdb) set sharedlibrary preload-libraries off
(gdb) rb doModInitFunctions // break at this function
(gdb) info sh // find the base offset
(gdb) dump memory <file> [base] [base+crypt size]

problems:
1. ida got some errors during disassembly
2. ldid -S switch returned error, -s switch worked but cannot run on device
3. gdb running the unmodified app will stop due to sigabort
